# react-fullscreen-app-boilerplate

Heavily inspired by http://jsfiddle.net/MadLittleMods/LmYay/ and the challenge of delivering a fullscreen, responsive multi-route React + Redux app.

## Testing of functional components

- Sourced from Eric Elliot's react-pure-component-starter
https://github.com/ericelliott/react-pure-component-starter/blob/master/source/test/components/title/index.js
- Opinionated in that all a component should test is that it actually can render
